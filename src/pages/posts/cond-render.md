# Conditional Rendering

Published on: 2023-01-13

Conditional rendering is the ability to render content when a certain condition is met. Most web frameworks including Astro implement conditional rendering, it makes Single Page Applications (SPA) dynamic  and more interactive. 

You can use script variables in astro to decide whether or not to render contents of the HTML `<body>` content.
```astro
{happy && <p>Astro is awesome</p>}
{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial</p>}
{happy && <p>My goal is to finish in three days</p>}
```
