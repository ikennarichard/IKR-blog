Welcome to my blog about learning Javascript and Astro here I will share my learning journey as I build projects.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First i created a new project with `npm create astro@latest` and set up my online accounts

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to create pages with `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` directory.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post!  I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!


## What's next

Watch out for more posts.
