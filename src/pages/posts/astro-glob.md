Astro provides a way to fetch local files into your site with Astro.glob. The Astro.glob function takes one parameter, a relative URL of the files to fetch and returns an array of the matching files. The process is asynchronous.

```astro
const allPosts = await Astro.glob('../pages/posts/*.md')
```

Under the hood `Astro.glob` uses Vites `import.meta.glob()` which brings us to the point, Astro.glob dosent support dynamic variables or string interpolation only static string literals. This is due to a limitation in Vite's `import.meta.glob()` implementation. 

One way to get around this limitation is to import all the files you need using `Astro.glob()`, then filter them
```astro
const posts = await Astro.glob('../pages/blog/*.md');
const myFeaturedPost = posts.find(post => post.file.includes(pathToMyFeaturedPost));
```
